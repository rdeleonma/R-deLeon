    				<h2> A little about me.</h2>
    				<div class="half-width">
    					<p>I have just started getting into web development and am continuing to study and complete online courses. I decided to explore more into the field after leaving the business world and taking a brief hiatus to "figure things out". I came to the realization that in order to find a career I would actually enjoy I needed to find something where I could apply my diverse <span>and quite quirky</span> skillset.</p>
    				</div>
    				<div class="half-width">
    					<p>That realization then led me to a field where my highly inquisitive nature, attention to detail, and perserverance would come in very handy.  When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom, versatility, and satisfaction I was looking for in my work. This page is a work in progress and place to show off and continue to practice as I build upon my new skills.</p>

    					<h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
    					<p>My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.</p>

    					<img src="img/icon-css.png" alt="CSS Icon" />
    					<h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>
    					<p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.</p>

    					<h3>Ease Converting Designs into Code</h3>
    					<p>You can trust me to take a designer's PSD and quickly & accurately convert it into a webpage that is pixel-perfect match.</p>
